    <h1>Music: Janaya's Form of Cultural Expression</h1>
    <p>Music is important to me in many ways. It lightens my mood and, most of all, it allows me to connect with my cultural background. I am Dominican and Puerto Rican. I love expressing and appreciating my culture through my music choices. Furthermore, I enjoy a vast array of genres like Salsa, Bachata, and Merengue. These forms of music not only allow me to connect with my culture but also with my family. That is why music is so prevalent in my life. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>This song is the most important in my life. It highlights the struggles my father went through when he immigrated from the Dominican Republic. Its ability to lyrically show the hardships is why this song is most important to me.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBacuhimW8k">"Mi Mujer Me Gobierna" by La Banda Gorda</a>
            <ul>
                <li>This song is one of my favorites because of the rhythm and the fact that it can always lift my spirits! This song never fails to make me dance, and I have wonderful memories dancing this song with my father.</li>
